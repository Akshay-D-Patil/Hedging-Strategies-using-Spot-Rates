# Hedging-Strategies-using-Spot-Rates

The spot rates can be used to hedge fixed income securities. The objective of this project is to
compare the hedging strategies implemented using Modified duration-matching barbell strategy,
Macaulay duration-matching barbell strategy, Simple regression-based hedging, and Regressionbased
hedging using multiplicative portfolios. This project picks the optimal strategy to hedge the
excess return of 3-year and 7-year maturity zero-coupon bonds based on the root-mean square
hedging errors(RMSHE). Also, we look at the time series variation in the spot rates using the yield
curve factors, level, slope, and curvature.
